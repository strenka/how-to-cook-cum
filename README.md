500 ml milk
1 tbsp butter
1-2 tbsp granulated sugar
1 pinch of salt
70 g semolina (fine)
a little cinnamon
icing sugar or grated chocolate (for sprinkling)

DIRECTIONS FOR SEMOLINA PUDDING
Slowly bring milk and butter to boil in a pot and then add sugar and a pinch of salt.
Slowly pour in semolina and bring to boil stirring continuously and simmer until creamy. The longer it cooks, the firmer it will become.
Meanwhile, mix sugar (amount depends on taste) with a generous amount of cinnamon.
Pour the porridge onto warmed dishes and sprinkle with sugar-cinnamon mixture and drizzle with browned butter or only grated chocolate, according to taste.
